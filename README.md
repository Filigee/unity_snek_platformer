# Unity Snek Platformer

This is a 2D Bullet Hell Platformer game that I developed in Unity.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** C#, Unity Engine, WebGL

<strong>Conceptualization and Planning:</strong><br>
The first step was to come up with a concept and plan out the game's mechanics, art style, and overall gameplay. I knew that I wanted the core mechanic to be a combination of platforming and bullet dodging, so everything that came after that was planned around those mechanics. Then I decided it would be a fun to base the game's theme off Cryptocurrency memecoins. 

<strong>Creating the Scripts:</strong><br>
I then created the Player Character's controller script and added all of the different mechanics that I wanted to player to have, including jumping, dashing and shooting. I definitely found this challenges but ultimately enjoyed digging through the Unity docs to find different ways to implement the things that I wanted. I then went on to repeat this process for the design of all of the different enemies and their different abilities.

<strong>Fine-Tuning Gameplay:</strong><br>
Many times throughout development I had to come back to certain stats and mechanics and tweak them as they were affecting the experience of the game.

<strong>Final Testing and Publishing:</strong><br>
I then published the game on Github using WebGL and had a few friends test it out, which was a great experience!
    
## Optimizations

One thing that I'd like to come back to in this project would be to refactor the code, as I wrote this when I was first starting out I can see now a lot of areas that could be condensed and/or just made easier to read and understand.

## Lessons Learned:

I've definitely learned through this project that when projects gets to a certain size it's VERY important for the code and files to be well-organised, otherwise it just becomes almost impossible to maintain and update.
